the data from your existing WooCommerce shop to our ERP system. From now on, you can manage your online
shop and your entre business with JTL-Wawi and profit from an efficient process chain that comprises

WooCommerce shops use, too. Further functions can be individually programmed and added using JTL-Connector.

== Why use an ERP system? ==

Transfer data from existing applications quickly and connect with a variety of online shop systems.

The software allows you to easily keep track of all your sales channels. You can also automate your
processes and deal with complex tax issues.

Many sellers also use JTL-Connector to transfer their data to JTL-Wawi and test our
proprietary online shop system [JTL-Shop](https://www.jtl-software.de/online-shopsystem).


== STARTING EASY WITH STANDARD VERSIONS ==

Sellers often use standard shop systems without personalised features, plug-ins and added functions.
Out-of-the-box shops like these can be connected to JTL-Wawi with a few simple steps using JTL-Connector.


== CONNECTING INDIVIDUAL PLUG-INS ==

You have made individual adjustments to your shop, e.g. the installation of plug-ins? In this case,
JTL-Connector needs an individual configuration for each of the plug-ins. To facilitate this, JTL-Connector
features an integrated [plug-in interface](https://www.jtl-software.de/anbindung-shopsysteme#plugin-system-fuer-individualisierte-onlineshops),
enabling the transfer of personalised data and functions to JTL-Wawi.


== HOW IT WORKS ==

* Initial data synchronisation

In the course of the initial synchronisation, data such as items, categories, images and customer and
order information is transferred from your shop to JTL-Wawi. If you want to use JTL-Wawi as the leading
system, you can directly and exclusively manage your products and process your online shop orders in
JTL-Wawi right after the initial synchronisation.

* Individual data maintenance

Many of the performance features that JTL-Wawi offers can also be used in your online shop via the
JTL-Connector, provided your shop system also offers these functionalities. Some functionalities of
your online shops are not transferred by JTL-Connector by default. Those can be added individually via
plug-ins or additional programming.

* Continuous synchronisation

The data created or changed by you in JTL-Wawi is transferred to your shop via the
online shop synchronisation. Orders placed in your shop are directly forwarded to JTL-Wawi.
You can process all orders, including shipping and returns, in JTL-Wawi. The current order
status is transferred to your shop via JTL-Connector. In this way, your customers are always
informed about the status of their orders.

* Combined operation

You can also operate JTL-Connector and your shop in a combined mode. In this case, you define what
data is to be imported into JTL-Wawi or transferred to your online shop. You can specify, for example,
that JTL-Wawi only updates stocks for the shop and only imports orders. This means that you still maintain
your products in the back end of your online shop.


== FUTURE-PROOF DEVELOPMENT ==

JTL-Software holds all the knowledge to ensure the future-proof development of the JTL connectors.
This know-how enables us to react quickly to changing requirements and to adapt JTL-Connector to
evolving connected shop systems. This ensures trouble-free compatibility with future versions.
